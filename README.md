# Cybersecurity-Program
A cybersecurity strategy is a high-level plan for how your organization will secure its assets during the next three to five years. Obviously, because technology and cyber threats can both change unpredictably, you'll almost certainly have to update your strategy sooner than three years from now. A cybersecurity strategy isn't meant to be perfect; it's a strongly educated guess as to what you should do. Your strategy should evolve as your organization and the world around you evolve.


The intended outcome of developing and implementing a cybersecurity strategy is that your assets are better secured. This generally involves a shift from a reactive to proactive security approach, where you're more focused on preventing cyber attacks and incidents than reacting to them after the fact. But a solid cybersecurity strategy will also better prepare your organization to respond to those incidents that do occur. By preventing minor incidents from becoming major ones, your organization can preserve its reputation and reduce harm to the organization and its employees, customers, partners and others.
